# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System-using-Deep-Learning
   Aim of this project is to develop an algorithm which has better performance than the existing methods.This project is basically detecting any unauthorised intruder in the network.This intruder can be through DDOS, Probe attack, U2R ,R2L attacks,etc.NSL-KDD and CIC-NID-2017 datasets have been used for training the models.
My contribution:-
  -Applying different combination of algorithms on the two datasets.
  -Tuning the hyperparameters of the model 
  -Applying Ensemble method
